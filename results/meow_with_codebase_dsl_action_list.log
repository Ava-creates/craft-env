Crafting an item requires collecting the primitives/items needed and then going to one of the workshops to craft the item.\n\n  This implementation is based on the idea of moving towards the nearest primitive/item or workshop using simple BFS (Breadth-First Search) pathfinding, checking if we have collected all the items needed for crafting, and then moving towards a workshop. This implementation assumes that there are no obstacles blocking the agent's path.\n  \n  We'll use the following actions:\n    - 0: DOWN\n    - 1: UP\n    - 2: LEFT\n    - 3: RIGHT\n    - 4: USE\n  \n  To simplify, we will consider only one workshop, which is at index `env.action_specs()['USE']` and assume it can craft any item.\n  \n  We'll use BFS to find the shortest path to a primitive/item or workshop. The function will return a sequence of actions that lead to crafting the desired item.\n\n  Args:\n    env: CraftLab environment instance.\n    item_index: Index of the item we want to craft.\n\n  Returns:\n    A list of actions that lead to crafting the desired item.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # Get the primitives needed for the item\n  primitives_needed = env.world.cookbook.primitives_for(item_index)\n  print(f\"Primitives needed: {primitives_needed}\")\n  \n  # Initialize a queue for BFS and a set to keep track of visited positions\n  grid_shape = (env._width, env._height)\n  start_pos = np.array(env._current_state.pos)\n  queue = collections.deque([(start_pos, [])])\n  visited = set()\n  visited.add(tuple(start_pos))\n  \n  # Define the directions for movement (DOWN, UP, LEFT, RIGHT)\n  directions = [\n      np.array([1, 0]),  # DOWN\n      np.array([-1, 0]), # UP\n      np.array([0, -1]), # LEFT\n      np.array([0, 1])   # RIGHT\n  ]\n  \n  # Define a function to check if the position is within bounds and not visited\n  def is_valid(pos):\n    return (0 <= pos[0] < grid_shape[0] and \n            0 <= pos[1] < grid_shape[1] and \n            tuple(pos) not in visited)\n  \n  # Define a function to get the actions for moving towards a target position\n  def get_actions(start_pos, end_pos):\n    path = [end_pos]\n    current_pos = np.array(end_pos)\n    \n    while not np.array_equal(current_pos, start_pos):\n      min_dist = float('inf')\n      next_action = None\n      \n      for i, direction in enumerate(directions):\n        neighbor_pos = current_pos + direction\n        if tuple(neighbor_pos) in visited:\n          dist = np.linalg.norm(start_pos -
