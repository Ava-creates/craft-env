However, there are several issues and missing components that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Accessing Current Position and Direction**: The current position (`pos`) and direction (`dir`) of the agent are not directly accessible from `env._current_state`. Instead, they should be accessed using appropriate methods or attributes.\n2. **Handling Inventory and Neighbors**: The function should properly handle inventory checks and neighbor calculations.\n3. **Crafting at Workshops**: The function should correctly identify and use workshops for crafting items.\n\nBelow is a revised version of the `craft_func_v2` function that addresses these issues:\n\n```python", "scores": [-1, false]}
